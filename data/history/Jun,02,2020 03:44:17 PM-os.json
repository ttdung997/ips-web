For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissionsmust be satisfied as well as the AppArmor MAC rules.

Under AppArmor MAC rules are appliedby file paths instead of by security contexts as in other MAC systems. As such it does notrequire support in the filesystem and can be applied to network mounted filesystems forexample. AppArmor security policies define what system resources applications can accessand what privileges they can do so with. This automatically limits the damage that thesoftware can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take anyaction to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissionsmust be satisfied as well as the AppArmor MAC rules. The action will not be allowed ifeither one of these models does not permit the action.

If the system is notintended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only processlocal mail.Rationale:The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history ofsecurity issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mailmessages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless theserver is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems.Audit:Run the following command to verify that the MTA is not listening on any non-loopbackaddress ( 127.0.0.1 or ::1 )Nothing should be returned# ss -lntu | grep -E ':25\\s' | grep -E -v '\\s(127.0.0.1|::1):25\\s'Remediation:Edit \/etc\/postfix\/main.cf and add the following line to the RECEIVING MAIL section.

While several methodsof configuration exist this section is intended only to ensure the resulting IPtables and rulesare in place, not how they are configured. If IPv6 is in use in your environment, similarsettings should be applied to the IP6tables as well.3.5.1 Configure IPv6 ip6tablesIp6tables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv6 packet filter rules in theLinux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number ofbuilt-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains. Each chain is a list of rules whichcan match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. Thisis called \u00e0target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.If IPv6 in enabled on the system, the ip6tables should be configured.Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty ip6tables firewall ruleset(established by flushing the rules with ip6tables -F). Remediation steps included only affectthe live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to applyon boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection willoften result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configurationset to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then runand tested before saving to boot.

Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events thatmay be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system loginformation may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified thelocal log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure itto process the logs described in this section.Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems(particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronizedamong systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocolfor time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by mostnetwork-ready devices. See the ntpd(8) manual page for more information on configuringNTP.It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis andcorrelated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be moresignificant when compared to an entry in another log.Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a \"one size fits all\" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators whoare in a defined security group, such as \"wheel\" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to havegroup permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root.Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is forsystems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root toread the log files (root:root 600). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and aredesignated as root:securegrp 640where securegrpis the defined security group (in somecases wheel).4.1 Configure System Accounting (auditd)System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systemssuch that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditdwill audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authenticationevents. Events will be logged to \/var\/log\/audit\/audit.log. The recording of these eventswill use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events arecaptured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated.The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces largequantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or processthese logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations. Note:For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.Note: Several recommendations in this section filter based off of auid>=500 forunprivileged non-system users. Some distributions split at UID 1000 instead, consult yourdocumentation and\/or the UID_MIN setting in \/etc\/login.defs to determine which isappropriate for you.Note: Once all configuration changes have been made to\/etc\/audit\/rules.d\/audit.rules, the auditd configuration must be reloaded with thefollowing command:# service auditd reload4.1.1 Configure Data RetentionWhen auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for auditlogs.

The mount (and umount ) system call controls themounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system tocreate an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged userRationale:It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. Whiletracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external mediamay have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it'san external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to themedia. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would alsohave to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to afile under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fairindication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to tracksuccessful writes to the external media.

It is recommendedthat the output of this command be redirected to a file that can be reviewed later.# rpm -Va --nomtime --nosize --nomd5 --nolinkto > <filename># dpkg --verify > <filename>Remediation:Correct any discrepancies found and rerun the audit until output is clean or risk ismitigated or accepted.References:1. http:\/\/docs.fedoraproject.org\/en-US\/Fedora_Draft_Documentation\/0.1\/html\/RPM_Guide\/index.htmlNotes:Since packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it isrecommended to verify everything, not just a finite list of files. This can be a timeconsuming task and results may depend on site policy therefore it is not a scorablebenchmark item, but is provided for those interested in additional security measures.Some of the recommendations of this benchmark alter the state of files audited by thisrecommendation. The audit command will alert for all changes to a file permissions even ifthe new state is more secure than the default.CIS Controls:Version 614.4 Protect Information With Access Control ListsAll information stored on systems shall be protected with file system, network share,claims, application, or database specific access control lists.
